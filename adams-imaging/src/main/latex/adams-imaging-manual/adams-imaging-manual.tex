\chapter{ADAMS}
ADAMS has custom image processing support that does not rely on other libraries.

The following actors are available:
\begin{tight_itemize}
	\item \texttt{sink.ImageFileWriter} -- writes an image container to a file
	using the specified writer.
	\item \texttt{transformer.BufferedImageTransformer} -- performs a transformation
	using an existing transformer class on the incoming image and
	outputs another image again.
	\item \texttt{transformer.BufferedImageFeatureGenerator} -- turns a
	\texttt{BufferedImageContainer} into an \texttt{weka.core.Instance} object to
	be used in WEKA. The attaced meta-data in form of a report can be added to the
	output object as well.
	\item \texttt{transformer.ImageFileReader} -- reads an image file using the
	specified image reader.
\end{tight_itemize}

Figure \ref{adams-blur-flow} shows a
flow\footnote{adams-imaging-gaussian\_blur.flow} for reading images, blurring
them using a gaussian blur transformer and displaying them side-by-side. Figures
\ref{adams-blur-output-original} and \ref{adams-blur-output-blurred} show original
and blurred image.

\chapter[Java Advanced
Imaging]{\parbox[b]{1.2cm}{\includegraphics[width=1cm]{images/jai.png}}\parbox[c]{14cm}{Java
Advanced Imaging}}
Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) is an API to provide a simple, high-level
programming model which allows developers to create their own image manipulation
routines\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Advanced_Imaging}{}}.

Reading and writing images are done using the \textit{ImageFileReader} transformer
and \textit{ImageFileWriter} sink:
\begin{tight_itemize}
	\item \texttt{ImageFileReader} -- use the \textit{JAIImageFileReader}
	\item \texttt{ImageFileWriter} -- use the \textit{JAIImageFileWriter}
\end{tight_itemize}

Since the JAI actors, readers and writers use \texttt{BufferedImageContainer}, the 
\texttt{BufferedImageTransformer} and \texttt{BufferedImageFeatureGenerator}
transformers can be used.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{LIRE}

\begin{tight_itemize}
  \item AutoColorCorrelogram

  \item CEDD
  \item ColorLayout
  \item EdgeHistogram
  \item FCTH
  \item FuzzyColorHistogram
  \item FuzzyOpponentHistogram

  \item LuminanceLayout
  \item OpponentHistogram
  \item PHOG
  \item RotationInvariantLocalBinaryPatterns
  \item ScalableColor
  \item SimpleColorHistogram
  \item Tamura
\end{tight_itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Object conversion}
The following conversions are available:
\begin{tight_itemize}
  \item \textit{ColorToHex} -- turns a Color into its hexa-decimal
  notation.
  \item \textit{HexToColor} -- turns a color in hexa-decimal notation back
  into a Color object.
  \item \textit{LocatedObjectToRectangle} -- extracts the location of the
  object and stores it in a rectangle object.
  \item \textit{LocatedObjectsToReport} -- converts the array of LocatedObject
  instances into a Report.
  \item \textit{ObjectAnnotationsToImageSegmentationLayers} -- converts the
  object annotations into layers for image segmentation.
  \item \textit{QuadrilateralLocationCenter} -- outputs the center of the
  QuadrilateralLocation object.
  \item \textit{QuadrilateralLocationToString} -- turns the
  QuadrilateralLocation object into its string representation.
  \item \textit{RectangleCenter} -- outputs the center of the rectangle object.
  \item \textit{RectangleToString} -- converts the rectangle object into its
  string representation.
  \item \textit{StringToQuadrilateralLocation} -- creates a QuadrilateralLocation
  object from this string representation.
  \item \textit{StringToRectangle} -- creates a rectangle object from the string
  representation.
\end{tight_itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{OCR}
A common task in image processing is \textit{optical character recognition} 
(OCR). ADAMS offers a simple wrapper around the open-source \textit{tesseract} 
engine \cite{tesseract}. The engine is available for Windows, Linux and Mac OSX.
It supports multiple languages, however, these need to be installed in order to
be actually available.

The follwoing actors are available:
\begin{tight_itemize}
	\item \textit{TesseractConfiguration} -- standalone for configuring OCR, 
	mainly to define where the tesseract executable is located.
	\item \textit{TesseractOCR} -- this transformer turns an image file into
	one or more text files, which need to be further processed in the flow
	then.\footnote{adams-imaging-ocr.flow}
\end{tight_itemize}

By default, the \textit{TesseractConfiguration} standalone uses the globally
defined preferences as default values. In the preferences dialog 
(\textit{Main menu $\rightarrow$ Program $\rightarrow$ Preferences 
$\rightarrow$ Tesseract}) you can specify the location of the tesseract
executable and the default language (see Figure \ref{tesseract-preferences}).
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=10.0cm]{images/tesseract-preferences.png}
  \caption{Preferences for tesseract.}
  \label{tesseract-preferences}
\end{figure}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Interaction}
The \textit{PixelSelector} transformer allows the user to interact with the
flow. The interaction with the user works as follows: an image viewer instance
is displayed when the \textit{PixelSelector} transformer receives an image token
as input. The use then right-clicks on a pixel that he wants to process, e.g.,
labelling for WEKA data generation. After all the pixels have been selected and
processed, the user then hits the \textit{OK} button to close the dialog. The
\textit{PixelSelector} then forwards the image container with the
attached, enriched report for further processing.

The \textit{PixelSelector} transformer is very generic, which means the actor
is responsible for the actions that the user can select from the right-click
menu. This is done by selecting the appropriate actions from the list of
available ones, e.g., \textit{AddClassification} (package
\texttt{adams.flow.transformer.pixelselector}), which is used for attaching
classification labels to pixels. In order to make these selections visible not
just in the report that is displayed on the right-hand side in the dialog,
appropriate overlays can be selected as well, e.g., the
\textit{ClassificationOverlay} (package
\texttt{adams.flow.transformer.pixelselector}) overlay, which displays the
pixels with the associated labels on the screen.

Figure \ref{pixelselector-flow} shows a
flow\footnote{adams-imaging-pixelselector.flow} that lets the user hand-label
all JPG images in a directory and generated WEKA data from it. It uses a cropped
region of 5x5 pixels around the selected pixels for the data generation. The
user interface for selecting the pixels is shown in Figure
\ref{pixelselector-interaction} and a resulting dataset in Figure
\ref{pixelselector-dataset}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=10.0cm]{images/pixelselector-flow.png}
  \caption{Flow for generating ARFF file from user-labelled pixels.}
  \label{pixelselector-flow}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=10.0cm]{images/pixelselector-interaction.png}
  \caption{User interface for labelling pixels, displaying some pixels
  labelled already.}
  \label{pixelselector-interaction}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=10.0cm]{images/pixelselector-dataset.png}
  \caption{Example dataset generated using the PixelSelector.}
  \label{pixelselector-dataset}
\end{figure}

Of course, due to the interactive nature, labelling is performed on-the-fly and
no record is kept. Once the image has been processed, the
\textit{PixelSelector} will forget about it. If you want to preserve the
attached report, you can use the \textit{ReportFileWriter} transformer to save
the report to disk. 

In order to re-use a previously saved report, you can use the
\textit{SetReportFromFile} or \textit{SetReportFromSource} transformer to
replace the default report in the image container after you loaded the image
with the one stored on disk. This allows you to continue work with previously
generated labels, saving you a lot of work.

Since the \textit{SetReportFromFile} and \textit{SetReportFromSource}
transformers generate \textit{ReportHandler} tokens, you need to explicitly
cast the type of the tokens to the desired one, e.g.,
\textit{BufferedImageContainer}, using the \textit{Cast} control actor.

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Feature output}
Of course, the data can be turned into a format that is suitable for machine 
learning applications like WEKA (\cite{weka}). For JAI transformer tokens, the
\textit{BufferedImageFeatureGenerator} can be used to generate such output.
