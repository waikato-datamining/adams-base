\chapter{Introduction}
The \textit{adams-weka} module offers most of the functionality found in WEKA
\cite{weka}: pre-processing, classification and regression, clustering,
attribute selection, data visualization and visualization of results/models.
But it does not stop there: the module also contains other features for
optimization, experiment generation that are not available from WEKA, be it
Explorer or KnowledgeFlow. It is assumed that you are familiar with
WEKA\footnote{If you haven't used WEKA before, check out the Data Mining book
\cite{wekabook}, which gives you a good introduction to machine learning, data
mining and WEKA.} and machine learning in general, as common terms are not
explained again.

If you have used WEKA's KnowledgeFlow before, then you will have to forget
(mostly) everything that you know about setting up workflows. ADAMS does things
quite differently in comparison to the WEKA. Additionally, ADAMS offers a range
of general purpose actors that allow you to go further.

The manual is split into several sections, with: \textit{classification and regression}
and \textit{clustering} comprising the most important sections.

\chapter{Logging}
Weka performs its own logging of stdout and stderr, which can amount to very
large log files on the server, which will never get cleared. In order to
turn off logging, perform the following steps:
\begin{tight_itemize}
  \item create the following directory if not already present: \verb|$HOME/wekafiles/props|
  (or \verb|%USERPROFILE%\wekafiles\props| for Windows)
  \item in this directory, create file \textit{Logging.props} with the following content:
  \begin{verbatim}
weka.core.logging.Logger=weka.core.logging.ConsoleLogger
  \end{verbatim}
\end{tight_itemize}
