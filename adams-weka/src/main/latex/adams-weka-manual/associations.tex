\chapter{Associations}
\label{associations}

Associators in WEKA are very limited in terms what you can do with them: you
can build an associator and output its rules, it the algorithm supports it.
The flow\footnote{adams-weka-associator.flow} in Figure \ref{associator}
shows how to train an associator using the \textit{WekaTrainAssociator}
transformer, which uses the Apriori setup obtained from the \textit{WekaAssociatorSetup}
source, and outputs the Apriori model and the rules that Apriori generated.
