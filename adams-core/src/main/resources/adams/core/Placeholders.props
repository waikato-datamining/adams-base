# Stores the system-wide defined placeholders, which can be used in filenames.
# A placeholder has to be uppercase and is only allowed to contain letters
# and underscores (no spaces). Placeholders can be used by surrounding them
# with "${" and "}". Here is an example of a file in the temp directory:
#   ${TMP}/something.arff
#
# The following special variables can be used in the placeholder definition
# as well:
# %t - the temp directory
# %h - the user's home directory (also $HOME and %USERHOME%)
# %p - the project's home directory (if such is available)
# %c - the current directory
# %% - gets replaced by a single percentage sign
#
# Notes:
# - Trailing path element separators ("/" or "\") are always stripped
